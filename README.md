# -BIOMETRIC-SYSTEM-FOR-IDENTIFICATION-USING-EEG-SIGNALS
This work aims to develop a biometric system for identification using Electroencephalogram as biometric modality. The biometric identification system are developed to prevent unauthorized access to privileged services. The manually extracted features has lot of variety and feature selection is required. So, a biometric system using 1-D CNN was developed for identification of users and convolutional layer was used for extracting features. The developed system was then used for authenticating the identity of the user. The dataset used for validating the performance of the developed system consists of 20 subjectâ€™s data collected using 4 channels EEG. The accuracies for the different auditory stimuli were compared using the developed architecture.
